# UnityBeginningRPG    

A 3D Role Playing Game made using the Unity engine.   

I originally started a Unity RPG project with a set of tutorials from Brackeys on YouTube:
"How to make an RPG in Unity - Introduction"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5nyrB9U_o&t=1s
This is a continuation of that project.     

I have been experimenting with terrain, adding models I created from Blender, adding features for crafting and building, 
creating quests, dynamically placing items, and more.     

This provides the building blocks for future RPGs.
