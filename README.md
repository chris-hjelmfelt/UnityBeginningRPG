# UnityBeginningRPG

A 3D Role Playing Game made using the Unity engine. It is currently just a project to learn and experiment. 

I originally started a Unity RPG project with a set of tutorials from Brackeys on YouTube:
"How to make an RPG in Unity - Introduction"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5nyrB9U_o&t=1s
This is a continuation of that project. I am experimenting with terrain, 3D models, adding 
features for crafting and building, and creating quests. This may become a fully playable game 
that I release at some point or more likely it will provide the building blocks for a future RPG.

For now this repo contains only the C# scripts, and none of the other assets.

I originally started the Brackey's tutorial March 2019.
